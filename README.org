* ABOUT CONFIG
Dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. Dwm is created by the good folks at https://suckless.org. This is my personal build of dwm. I used a number of patches in this build to make dwm more "sensible" rather than "suckless." The patches I added to this build include

+ attachaside (new clients appear in the stack rather than as the master)
+ cyclelayouts (cycles through the available layouts)
+ gridmode (adding a grid layout)
+ restartsig (allows dwm to be restarted with a keybinding)
+ rotatestack (moves a window through the stack, in either direction)
+ uselessgap (adding gaps when more than one window)
+ colorbar (allows the functionality to add colors to bars)
+ hide vacant tags patch
+ focus on active patch

If you use a login manager (like lightdm), make sure that you have a file called dwm.desktop in your /usr/share/xsessions/ directory.  It should look something like this:

#+begin_example
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Dwm
Comment=Dynamic window manager
Exec=dwm
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession
#+end_example

* INSTALLATION
Clone this repository and recompile using the following
#+begin_example
sudo make clean install
#+end_example

* AUTOSTART
dwm-ashin has been patched in such a way that it looks for an autostart file at: $HOME/.local/share/dwm/autostart.sh
The example autostart.sh above launches the compton compositor, sets the wallpaper with feh and launches slstatus to add some widgets to our dwm panel.  

I use slstatus of suckless. My build of slstatus is [[here][https://github.com/ashincoder/slstatus-ashin]]

You will need to create this file and the directory that it is located.  An example autostart.sh is included below:

#+begin_example
#! /bin/bash
picom -CGb &
feh --bg-scale /usr/share/backgrounds/wallpapers/0052.jpg &
/usr/bin/dunst &
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr &
slstatus &
#+end_example

If you would like to use dwmblocks.
Then you would need to install [[dwmblocks][https://github.com/ashincoder/dwmblocks.git]] to use it.  To use my dwmblocks, you also need to download the scripts found [[here][https://github.com/ashincoder/dwmblocks/tree/main/scripts]].
